      "blurb": "Fried rice is the perfect weeknight meal: It requires minimal prep, simple pantry condiments and basic vegetables. Not to mention, it comes together quickly. Here, otherwise mild tofu is transformed into savory bites when cooked in soy sauce infused with aromatics, absorbing all of the rich, sweet-salty flavor and bringing depth to the dish. The rice seasonings are kept simple and bright with garlic and ginger, which allows the vegetables to shine. Use any mix of leftover vegetables: Cabbage, bell peppers and mushrooms are all great alternatives.",

      "name": "Vegan Poblano Macaroni and Cheese",
      "blurb": "Making this plant-based dish might become a new holiday tradition in your house — and the recipe is fast and easy enough to become part of your weeknight rotation as well. It’s not your average macaroni and cheese as it has no actual cheese, but its creamy cashew sauce, stained green from smoky fire-roasted poblano chiles, is guaranteed to turn heads. The end result is sure to be piled high on everyone’s plates.",
      "ingredients": [
        "1 cup raw cashews",
        "1 pound russet potatoes (about 3 medium), scrubbed and roughly chopped",
        "3 ounces carrot (1 medium), scrubbed and roughly chopped",
        "Salt, to taste",
        "10 ounces elbow macaroni (about 2 1/2 cups)",
        "10 ounces poblano (or pasilla) peppers (2 medium)",
        "1/3 cup nutritional yeast",
        "1 medium jalapeno (optional)"

      "content": [
        "Add the cashews to a small bowl and cover with hot tap water to soak for 20 minutes. Drain and set aside.",
        "Combine the potatoes and carrot in a medium pot with 4 cups of water, salt liberally, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Cook until the vegetables are fork-tender, 15-20 minutes. Reserve 1 1/2 cups of the cooking liquid, then drain.",
        "While the potatoes and carrots cook, bring 8 cups of water in a medium pot to boil over high. Salt liberally, and add the elbow pasta and cook until al dente according to package directions. Drain and return to the pot.",
        "While the potatoes and pasta cook, char the chiles: place the poblano chiles and jalapeno, if using, directly on the grate of a gas burner and turn the heat to high. Cook, using heatproof tongs to turn the chiles so they blister and blacken, on all sides, 8 to 10 minutes. Set aside to cool. Remove the stems and seeds and discard, then slice the chiles and set aside a few for garnish.",
        "Working in batches if necessary, blend the potatoes, carrot, cashews, chiles, and nutritional yeast and the reserved potato cooking water until smooth. Taste and season with salt. Add the sauce to the pasta and stir to coat. Turn the heat to low and let sit for about 5 minutes so the pasta absorbs some of the sauce. Serve hot, garnished with the reserved chiles."

      "name": "One-Pot Broccoli Mac and Cheese",
      "blurb": "In the time it takes to make boxed macaroni and cheese, you can have a homemade version that’s creamy with lots of sharp Cheddar, studded with broccoli and doesn’t require making a roux. Instead, the sauce is thickened by the pasta’s starch: As the noodles cook in milk, the milk thickens to the consistency of cream and the pasta absorbs the seasonings. Here, that’s garlic powder, but you could also use mustard powder, ground cayenne or grated nutmeg like in traditional mac and cheese. The broccoli pieces end up soft and sweet, but if you want more bite, add them halfway through cooking. (Watch the video of Ali Slagle making one-pot broccoli mac and cheese here.)",
      "ingredients": [
        "1 pound elbow macaroni",
        "1 pound broccoli, stem and florets coarsely chopped",
        "2 1/2 cups whole milk",
        "2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste",
        "1/2 teaspoon garlic powder",
        "8 ounces coarsely grated sharp Cheddar (about 2 cups)",

      "content": [
        "In a large pot or skillet, combine the macaroni, broccoli, milk, salt, and garlic powder. Add 3 cups of water, and stir to combine. (The pasta may not be fully submerged. That's OK!)",
        "Bring to an active simmer over medium-high. Reduce the heat to medium to gently simmer.",
        "Cook, stirring often to ensure even cooking and to keep things from sticking to the bottom of the pot, until pasta is tender and the liquid resembles heavy cream and coats the noodles, 8 to 12 minutes.",
        "If the liquid evaporates so much that you don't see any between noodles, add 1/2 cup water. Adjust the heat as needed to maintain a gentle simmer.",
        "Remove from heat and stir in the cheddar. Season to taste with salt and pepper."
